Drawing on a monochromatic bitmap canvas.

![example of using monochrome_draw package on an Akai Fire](doc/example1.jpeg)

A library of drawing routines for a monochromatic bitmap canvas, ported to Dart from the awesome [oled-js](https://github.com/noopkat/oled-js) by @noopkat. 

The canvas is hardcoded to be monochromatic, hence each pixel is represented as a boolean value. 

This library can be useful when using small, cheap monochromatic OLED displays. 

It works well with the [oled_font_57](https://pub.dev/packages/oled_font_57) package.
